/* Each client that is interested in knowing when the kernel is
   about to suspend so it can perform some last minute actions
   needs to follow the steps below.

   1) Each client needs to open up the droid_pm driver and register
      itself with the driver using the BRCM_IOCTL_REGISTER_EVENTS
      ioctl. The argument passed is an eventfd object that is used
      to provide events from the droid_pm driver to the client.

   2) The client can then use either the poll or select API on the
      eventfd object to block waiting for an event to be set by the
      droid_pm driver.  The client can then use the standard
      "eventfd_read()" API to obtain the actual event flags as defined
      above.

      If a "DROID_PM_EVENT_SUSPENDING" event is set, then the client
      can use this as a trigger to perform the necessary actions such
      as enabling wake-on-BLE.

   3) Once the client has performed its actions, it needs to inform
      the droid_pm driver that it is ready for the kernel to suspend
      or shutdown. This is achieved by issuing the ioctl
      "BRCM_IOCTL_SET_SUSPEND_ACK".

      NOTE: If more than one client has registered their interest in
      the kernel suspending, then each must issue the ioctl
      "BRCM_IOCTL_SET_SUSPEND_ACK" before the kernel can fully suspend
      or shutdown.

   4) After issuing the "BRCM_IOCTL_SET_SUSPEND_ACK" ioctl, each client
      should check whether the kernel successfully suspended or not by
      waiting for the "DROID_PM_EVENT_RESUMED" or
      "DROID_PM_EVENT_RESUMED_WAKEUP" event to be set by droid_pm.
      The client can simply poll and/or call "eventfd_read()" to obtain
      the event.

      If the client received the "DROID_PM_EVENT_RESUMED_WAKEUP" event,
      then it means that the kernel received a valid wake-up event and
      the client can then take appropriate action such as disabling WoBLE.

      If the "DROID_PM_EVENT_RESUMED" event was received instead, it means
      that the kernel did not fully suspend and this may be due to an
      active wake-lock preventing the kernel from suspending.

      If the kernel failed to fully suspend, then the client should repeat
      steps 2) to 4) again waiting for the kernel to begin suspending again.

   5) The "BRCM_IOCTL_SET_INTERACTIVE" ioctl is called by the Power HAL
      when a "set_interactive" callback is received by it.  This ioctl is
      used by droid_pm to correctly set the "DROID_PM_EVENT_INTERACTIVE_ON"
      or "DROID_PM_EVENT_INTERACTIVE_OFF" event.

   6) Once a client no longer needs to react to the events set by the droid_pm
      driver, it should issue the ioctl "BRCM_IOCTL_UNREGISTER_EVENTS".
